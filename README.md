# Bookshelf

The bookshelf is a spin off of a to do list. I was initially thinking of creating a to do list, but decided to go a different route.

This project was intended to demonstrate my skills as developer when it came to using higher order functions such as map, filter, forEach and others. During the use of this methods I learn more about them and how to properly use them.

On another note the React Context api was used in this project to help with the state of the application in regards to the theme of it.

Rather than having prop drill many components just to get the state I decided to use the Context api to help with state management. This solved the problem of prop drilling.

## Future technology

I do expect to use Redux for my next project since it will be sort of a different approach to state management and it is the trend.
